# RootGuard Core

![RootGuard Core – Secure DNS orchestration](assets/rootguard-core-social-preview.png)

**RootGuard Core is the authenticated control plane behind the RootGuard
self-hosted DNS stack.** It deploys and manages AdGuard Home and Unbound,
validates configuration changes, monitors the DNS chain, and performs protected
updates with automatic rollback.

> Core is an internal service and must not be exposed directly to a LAN or the
> internet. Use the complete RootGuard Compose stack for an end-user setup.

## What Core does

- Deploys the managed AdGuard Home and Unbound DNS data plane.
- Generates, previews, validates, versions, and restores Unbound configuration.
- Verifies DNS resolution, DNSSEC rejection, and the protected AdGuard upstream.
- Creates backups before service updates and rolls back failed replacements.
- Coordinates atomic Core/WebApp updates through the independent updater path.
- Keeps images, mounts, Compose content, and executable commands out of browser
  input.

```

## Local development

Requirements: Go 1.26+, Docker Engine, and a local RootGuard development
environment.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/foxly-it/rootguard-core.git
cd rootguard-core
go test ./...
go vet ./...
go build ./...
```

Run Core with a random internal API token:

```sh
ROOTGUARD_API_TOKEN="$(openssl rand -hex 32)" go run ./cmd/rootguard
```

Core listens on port `8081` by default. Except for `/api/health`, routes require
`Authorization: Bearer <ROOTGUARD_API_TOKEN>`.

For the complete development stack, clone the
[RootGuard main repository](https://github.com/foxly-it/rootguard) with its
submodules and run `docker compose up --build -d`.

## API areas

| Area | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Installation | Preflight checks, persistent progress, managed DNS deployment |
| Unbound | Settings, preview, validation, history, restore, diagnostics |
| AdGuard Home | Bootstrap, health, protected administration proxy |
| Service lifecycle | Allowlisted image checks, backup, update, rollback |
| Control plane | Paired Core/WebApp update requests and status |

Every configuration change is validated before activation. If Unbound cannot
restart or the DNS chain fails its health checks, Core restores the previous
known-good state.

## Security model

- Token-authenticated internal API with a minimal public health endpoint.
- No UI rendering and no user-supplied container specifications.
- Allowlisted services, images, paths, and operations.
- Deterministic configuration generation and bounded version history.
- Backup-backed updates with DNS and DNSSEC verification.
